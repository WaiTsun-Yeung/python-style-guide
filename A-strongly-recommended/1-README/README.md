The primary purpose of a README.md is to instruct _usage_ of the repository from download to deployment, assuming 
only minimal user understanding of package distribution systems. A README.md document is also important for asserting 
the legal rights of the contributors and the users, which all users of the repository are taken to have implicitly 
agreed with the legal terms posted by its contributors.

Given the importance of a good README.md file, there are ample online resources on how to write one. To name a few 
examples:

- [Template and structure - makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) describes a comprehensive outline on what can 
  be included in a README.md file, complete with an instructive template and renderer. This is especially useful for 
  coders without convenient means to preview their own README.md file.
- [GitHub Docs - Basic writing and formatting syntax](
  https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
  and [GitHub Guides - Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) are GitHub's guides
  to the formatting syntax of README.md files. Special attention should be paid to [GitHub-flavoured markdown 
  specifications](https://github.github.com/gfm/#what-is-github-flavored-markdown-), for GitHub is the most popular 
  platform that hosts and displays README.md documents.
- [Markdown Guide - Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is a compendious syntax guide for vanilla 
  Markdown documents, which also applies for GitHub-rendered README.md files. Note that image rendering and HTML syntax 
  are also supported, which is useful when a more elaborate README.md file needs to be made.
